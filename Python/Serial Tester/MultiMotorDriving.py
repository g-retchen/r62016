# Rolly Noel performed major rennovations January, 2017
#   including replacing backing up to correct overshoot, with slowing down slightly before the target is reached;
#   also learning from previous over/undershoots at each power setting so can nail it next time;
#   as well as renaming it from LEGO_Multi_Motor_Encoder_Test_ABK.

# This intends to accurately & reliably control the rotation of LEGO motors attached to a Raspberry Pi
#   via a Dexter Industries BrickPi

# BrickPi's first Arduino runs motor ports A & b, as well as sensor ports 1 & 2. Arduino 2 does the rest of them.
# You may get better performance (certainly fewer communication errors with the BrickPi, and less work using my version
#   of the BrickPi.py driver) if you place all your motors and sensors on the same Arduino (if possible).
# Rolly's version of BrickPi.py won't bother to poll (triggered by BrickPi.UpdateValues()) an Arduino without gear.

"""
Pass the arguments in a list. 
If a single motor has to be controlled then the arguments should be passed like 
elements of an array,e.g, motorRotateDegree([255], [360], [PORT_A]) where power=255 and
angle=360 for the motor connected at Port A
For multi motor calls: motorRotateDegree([255, 255], [1000, 1000], [PORT_A, PORT_B]) 
"""
#power=[255]
#deg=[360]
#port=[PORT_A]
#motorRotateDegree(power,deg,port)      #This reads the encoder values every 100 ms (default). Not that accurate but not very processor intensive
#motorRotateDegree(power,deg,port,.05)	#This reads the encoder values every 50 ms. A little more accurate 
#motorRotateDegree(power,deg,port,0)	#This reads the encoder values without any delay. Most accurate but take a lot of processing power

# An alternative to DI's motorRotateDegree
